# Moduit.Reqres.Test
API testing on Reqres

This test performed to check if User able to create chaining test API
unfortunately I have a lack infomation on how to do in Reqres by using Postman as a tool
So I can't do it properly, I can't adding one data and then modified it in other request, it's because the data is not saved. (sorry I can't find a way to do it, I should learn more)

Here are the tests I can do:
1. Add a new data by POST request
2. Modified the exact input text data to another text
3. Performing register data with result of success
4. Performing login succes 

Thanks
